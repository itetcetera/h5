# html5 beautifier

The parser is written by Google Go team. What I create is simply a pretty print renderer.
Unlike HTML tidy (its html5 version is still in early stage), this one is usable.

# usage 

```
	html5 < input.html > output.html	
```

# option

```
	-t: use tab
	-w=4: width
```

it will try to tranform input into *xhtml5*, which is stricter than html5.
